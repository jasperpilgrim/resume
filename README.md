Resume in HTML (hacked to pieces from https://jsonresume.org/)

Needed a resume. https://resumake.io/ to the rescue. Saved a PDF. But oh, no! Templates didn't have an 'About' or 'Profile' type top section. Cover letter? For a couple paragraphs? Checked Resumake's GitHub, realized learning React in one night might not be the brightest idea I've had. Attempted to upload resumake's compatible .json output to jsonresume.org's gist resource and ran into lots of param errors. Copied jsonresume's boilerplate's json, changed the theme, ran it through the gist resource, saved it as HTML, fired up VS CODE, and here we are. Seemed quicker than potentially ending up in a json nightmare. Time taken using the HTML: approximtely 30 minutes, most of it double checking that the years match my original Resumake PDF.
